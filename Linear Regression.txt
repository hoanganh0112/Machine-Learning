- Instead of analysis the observations, we think about modeling the relationship between the square footage of the house and the house sales price => use linear regression
#Method:
- Fitting a line through the data
- This line is defined by:
	fw(x) = W0 + W1*X 
	W0: intercept 
	slope: W1 => the weight on the feature X or regression coefficient
- RSS (residual sum of squares) => to use for dedicate the best line for model
	RSS = ($house1-[W0+W1sq.ft.house1])^2 + ($house2-[W0+W1sq.ft.house2])^2 + ($house3-[W0+W1sq.ft.house3])^2 + ($housen-[W0+W1sq.ft.housen])^2
        => the minus mean the difference between our observed house price vs what our model
- We choose the one minimizes the residual sum of squres
- hat: for predicted value
- Best guess of your house price:
